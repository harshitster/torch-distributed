    "##### 13. Likely Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: \"Why use Hessian instead of just gradients?\"**\n",
    "- \"Gradients (first-order) only show sensitivity - how much output changes with weight. Hessian (second-order) shows curvature and correlations - how weights interact. This lets us adjust multiple weights together optimally when compensating for quantization errors.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: \"What if calibration data doesn't match deployment?\"**\n",
    "- \"Accuracy degrades because the Hessian is computed on the wrong distribution. The compensation will be suboptimal. We need domain-representative calibration - for example, if deploying for code, calibrate on code, not general text.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: \"Can you quantize below 4-bit with GPTQ?\"**\n",
    "- \"Yes, but 3-bit is the boundary where accuracy starts dropping noticeably. At 2-bit, quantization noise dominates even with optimal compensation. Would need either mixed-precision (4-bit for important layers, 2-bit for others) or fine-tuning.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: \"How do you handle outlier weights?\"**\n",
    "- \"GPTQ handles outliers implicitly - they get high H_ii values (high importance), so their errors trigger more aggressive compensation in correlated weights. Can also use per-channel scales which give each output channel its own quantization range.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: \"Why block-wise quantization instead of one weight at a time?\"**\n",
    "- \"Computational efficiency. Quantizing one weight at a time is O(d_in²) per row. With blocks of 128, we reduce to O(d_in²/128). The accuracy difference is negligible because weights within a block have similar correlations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: \"Does GPTQ help with inference speed?\"**\n",
    "- \"Yes, but requires custom kernels. The quantized weights are smaller (4× reduction), but you need specialized CUDA/Metal kernels to actually compute in low precision. Without custom kernels, you dequantize to FP16 for computation, which saves memory but not compute time.\""
